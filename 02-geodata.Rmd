## Introduction

Two basic models used to represent spatial data are vector and raster data model.

### Vector data model

...
The Vector data model consists of two main elements: geometries and attributes.
The role of geometry is to describe the location and shape of spatial objects.
There are three basic types of geometries: points, lines, and polygons.
All of them are build using the same main idea of coordinates.

A point is represented by a pair of coordinates, usually described as X and Y.
It allows for locating this point in some space.
<!-- short CRS intro -->
X and Y could be unitless, in degrees, or in some measure units, such as meters.
<!-- maybe ref to CRS section here -->
<!-- ways to adjust points aesthetics: point sizes, colors, shapes, (markers/images) -->
Points can represents features on different scales, from a GPS position, location of a bench in a park, to a city in a small scale map.
Points can be also used to represent abstract features, such as locations of map labels.

A line extends the idea of a point.
It consists of several points (with coordinates)<!--vertex--> that are arranged in some order.
Consecutive points are connected by straight lines.
Therefore, a straight spatial line consists of two points (two pairs of coordinates), while complex spatial lines could be created based on a large number of points.<!--to rewrite-->
It gives the illusion that the line is curved. 
<!-- ways to adjust lines aesthetics: colors, lwd (line width) -->
<!-- in theory lty could be also used - but it is not implemented in tmap -->
Lines are used to represent linear features, such as roads, rivers, boundaries, footpaths, etc. 

A polygon is again a set of ordered points connected by straight lines. 
Its only difference from the line is that the first and the last point in a polygon has the same coordinates, and thus close the object.
<!-- ways to adjust polygons aesthetics: (fill) colors, (line/borders) colors -->
<!-- examples of polygons -->
The polygon representation is used to represent shapes and locations of different objects, from a lake or a patch of vegetation, through a building or a city block, to some administrative units. 
Polygons also have one unique feature - they could have holes. 
A polygon hole represents an area inside of the polygon but does not belong to it.
For example, a lake with an island can be depicted as a polygon with a hole.
